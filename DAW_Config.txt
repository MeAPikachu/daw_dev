# NOTE:
# The setting modes can be [COMMON] (all boards-related), "[BOARD] #" (single board-related) or "[CHANNEL] #" (single channel-related)
# The setting mode is specified by a C,B and G in the setting description
# If a setting is CHANNEL-related, it can also be BOARD-related or COMMON (i.e. the setting refers to all the channels in all the boards of the system) 
# However not all options that are COMMON can also be BOARD- or CHANNEL-related.  The "[BOARD] #" or "[CHANNEL] #" directives have no effect on such settings
# The "[BOARD] #" and "[CHANNEL] #" modes are alternative to [COMMON] but do not exclude each other. This means that one can issue a command to a 
# specific channel of a specific board, to all channels of a specific board or to a specific channel of all boards. 
# When the "[BOARD] #" mode is set, the following settings apply to all channels (even if a specific channel was previously selected)  
# The board index follows the board initialization order using the OPEN command (see below).
# The lines between the commands @OFF and @ON will be skipped. This can be used to exclude parts of the config file.
